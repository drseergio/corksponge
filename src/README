corksponge is a web application which brings a virtual cork noticeboard.

The initial use case is a virtual collage for sketching out life goals
similar to ideas expressed as "The law of attraction".

corksponge is licensed under AGPL 3.0

The webapp is built using Django as the backend and ExtJS as the client-side
library. It's designed to be deployed on Google AppEngine but can happily
exist in other environments.

Before deploying verify settings in 'app.yaml' and 'settings.py'.

To deploy in AppEngine:

$ python manage.py deploy

The admin console is accessible on /admin. To create an admin user use:

$ python manage.py remote createsuperuser
